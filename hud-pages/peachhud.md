# Frequently Asked Questions:

**Where's the friends-list?**  
It is a known source of FPS drops. Re-enable it in customizations/FriendsList.res.  
**Why can't I join my friend's party?**  
That's a Steam API bug unrelated to custom HUDs.  
**Where's the little person in the bottom left?**  
It is a known source of FPS drops. Re-enable it in customizations/ClassModel.res.  
**Does this work on Linux/Mac?**  
Rename the downloaded folder to be lowercase, then probably.
