# CosmosHUD

This HUD is a many months attempt to bring old TF2 and new TF2 together. It's still in it's early stages of development, but it is a project I would love to continue working on.

I hope you really enjoy it, and please let me know any feedback you have!

# Features

- Medals, EXP and Competitive Hidden (less HUD bloat)

- Improved UI features and navigability (a lot of button line up now and are very large and clickable)

- Improved Match HUD (now matches the original style)

- Overall style improvements that stick with the originals vision

- Working Regular and MinMode HUDs (MinMode features centered charge meters and additional elements that now support MinMode)

- Optional centered Health and Ammo counters (or warnings if you prefer that and can be toggled in HUD options)

- Improved MvM HUD

- Support for the Engineer Pipboy (made to resemble a PipBoy UI much closer than the original)

- A LOT of bug fixes with the original HUD (No match HUD in MvM on load, no repeat EXP sound effect, no overlapping HUD elements, etc.)

- A lot of love
