# Description

A Team Fortress 2 HUD designed specifically for use on jump servers.

# Features

Stripped down HUD designed to give you the ability to display exactly as much information as you want, at it's most bare only your clip ammo count is shown.

- Tempus HUD (Toggle)

## Useful buttons have been added to the pause menu including:

- Toggle HUD Min Mode (Disables health value and centers ammo count)

- Toggle Tempus HUD

- Toggle Tempus Speedo (Horizontal, Vertical, and Absolute)

- Toggle Full Bright

- Toggle Show Triggers

- Toggle Draw Clip Brushes

- Toggle Chat

- Toggle Net Graph


## Customization

Change the speedo colour by editing `speedocolor.cfg` in `jumphud/cfg`.

Use `cl_hud_minmode 1` to hide health value and center ammo count.

# Common Issues:

Speedos won't be recoloured or repositioned until one of the speedo buttons on the pause menu is used.

Tempus HUD elements are stubborn and sometimes reset to their natural colour. Turning the Tempus HUD on and off usually fixes this.
