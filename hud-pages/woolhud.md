A replica of Woolen's TF2 HUD - a minimal, gameplay-focused HUD, with added customizations.

# Info

My goal is to try to make the best replica with as few bugs as possible. Some things are not faithful to the original HUD because they are either bugged or ugly.

By default the newest version is used. `#alternatives` contain elements from older versions. `#customizations` are not faithful to Woolen's original HUD.

# Recommended customizations

For the best possible experience, I highly recommend enabling:

**#alternatives**
- main menu
- menu-normal-names-gamemenu.res
- game timers
- control point
- objectivestatusescort.res

**#customizations**
- more themed elements
- options-classloadoutpanel.res
- cleaner buildings panels
- metal-xhair-hudlayout.res
- centered mvm money
- payload race panel
