A replica of Woolen's Team Fortress 2 HUD - a minimal HUD with a focus on gameplay - with various customizations.

# Info

My goal is to try to make the best replica with as few bugs as possible. Some things are not faithful to the original HUD because they are either bugged or ugly.

By default the newest version is used. `#alternatives` contain elements from older versions. `#customizations` are not faithful to Woolen's original HUD.

# Recommended customizations

For the best possible experience, I recommend enabling:

**#alternatives**
- control point
- game timers
- main menu normal names
- main menu (if using with #more themed elements then rename `scripts` to `_scripts`)
- payload panel
- critical damage numbers

**#customizations**
- centered metal
- centered mvm money
- class loadout panel options
- cleaner buildings panels
- more themed elements
- payload race panel
- rectangular killstreak notice
