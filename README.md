# hud-db

Data repository tracking HUD metadata for comfig web

## How to use

Fork this repo, make a new branch, and add your HUD to this repository with a pull request (PR), and it will be synced to comfig web.

You can make subsequent PRs in new branches to update your HUD to a new version.

File hosting and version history is required to be on GitHub, for enhanced hosting and version approval.

## DB structure

There are 3 main folders for the HUDs:

* `hud-data/`
* `hud-resources/`
* `hud-pages/`

### HUD Data

This is the main data source for a HUD. This defines the HUD and its properties. You create a `.json` file called `hud-id.json`. Here's an example with explanations (please note that comments are not allowed in actual JSON):

`myhud.json`

```jsonc
{
  "name": "My HUD", // Display name of your HUD
  "author": "Cool person", // Display name of you, the active developer of the HUD
  "contributors": ["Original creator", "Previous maintainer"], // Display names of anyone you would like to credit for the creation/development of the HUD. Not to be used for general credits, but major and direct contributors. (optional)
  "social": {
    "steam_profile": 76561191234567890, // Your SteamID64 (optional)
    "steam_group": "valve", // Your Steam group (optional)
    "twitter": "Elon", // Your Twitter handle (optional)
    "discord": "vanity-or-invite", // Your Discord invite code, not the full URL (optional)
    "album": "https://imgur.com/a/fajsf" // Link to some Imgur album or other to provide more images (optional)
  },
  "repo": "https://github.com/cool-person/myhud", // GitHub repo web URL
  "hash": "84c64d403a650b3ae4793c9d32e01b3383445740", // Git commit hash of your current version (PR an update to this each time your HUD updates, and we will approve it)
  "prerelease": true, // If this is a prerelease/WIP HUD
  "resources": [ // A list of image names/YouTube videos. Images are automatically converted to webp, do not use extensions for uploaded images
    "myhud-banner", // First resource is the display banner in listings
    "cool-image-1", // Image names can be called any, namespaced to your HUD ID
    "https://youtu.be/21asadf" // Supports youtu.be links for video embeds
  ]
}
```

Here's an easy to copy sample for writing your own data file:

```json
{
  "name": "",
  "author": "",
  "social": {
    "steam_profile": 0,
    "steam_group": "",
    "twitter": "",
    "discord": ""
  },
  "repo": "",
  "hash": "",
  "resources": [
    "",
  ]
}
```

### HUD Pages

This is Markdown displayed in the description box of your HUD page. Similarly to the other files, you use your HUD ID as the name for your `.md` file.

To replicate a classic layout like the one on `huds.tf`:

`myhud.md`

```md
# Description

A **really** cool HUD

# Credits

Cool person #2 helped a lot with getting the coolness up to 11

# Special Thanks

I'd like to thank _all_ the cool peeps out there!
```

All standard Markdown is allowed at the moment but this may be changed in the future and is also subject to review.

### HUD Resources

You add resources that you list in your JSON to the `hud-resources/` folder, under your HUD ID (the name of your `.json` file without the extension):

```
hud-resouces/
│
└───myhud/
    |    myhud-banner.webp
    |    cool-image-1.webp
    └─
```

You can upload the images in any format in your PR. A bot will automatically transform them to the correct format upon merge, and optimize them as well. GIFs/animated images are not supported but may be in the future. Use YouTube links for videos.

There is no hard limit for how many resources you have, but an ideal soft limit would be around 10 to 20 images. This is to ensure that the repo doesn't become too bloated as more HUDs are added.

## Repo requirements

`hud-db` syncs with your HUD's GitHub repo to easily track and manage HUDs. There are some requirements for consistency on your end to enable us to provide this experience for all HUDs:

* The repo must contain the HUD directly, no subfolders, i.e., `info.vdf` must be in the root directory
* Use tags to mark new versions, and use GitHub releases to write changelogs. This is technically optional, but highly recommended.
* No force pushing over commits which have been published to the DB
* Do not delete tags after they have been published to the DB
* It's recommended to keep extra content in the repo to a minimum to prevent bloated downloads from GitHub. If you'd like to store additional files, it's recommended to use a separate branch or repo (for example for image content or other things).

We may also enforce some review requirements to ensure all HUDs we list meet a certain standard for publishing. These requirements are in flux while the moderation team settles on best practices and rules.

## Future work

Right now, the `hud-db` format is the bare minimum required to host a HUD listing.

In the future, we would like to standardize some things like HUD customization.
We would love to hear feedback from HUD authors on how this could be accomplished so that each HUD can specify customization features in a modular way, allowing for users to easily choose options in a graphical interface on the web.

We also would like to support feature flags as seen in huds.tf, but would like to revisit how this is done/displayed to be more flexible and useful.
